I. Data prep
    A. Parsing files:
        1. Iterate through all messages from oldest message to newest
        2. compile other persons messages as message
            2a. reverse message for better performance on seq2seq
            2b. Add <SOM>, <EOM> tokens?
        3. Compile my messages as response
            3a. Add <SOM>, <EOM> tokens?
        4. Add message => response pair to dictionary
            4a. write to tab-separated file

    B. Vectorizing words
        1. ???

II. 



PLAN:
Build Seq2Seq LSTM model to take in messages as input and output
